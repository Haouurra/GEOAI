This repo hosts related materials for our live demo entitled "Zero-Shot Buildings' Segmentation using SAM" at the 5th NOAA Workshop on Leveraging AI in Environmental Sciences.  

## Key Features

- A comprehensive Colab notebook for a live demo presented at the 5th NOAA AI Workshop.
  - This notebook contains a demo of the implementation of two CNNs acting as prompt generators for [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) on remote sensing data.
  - It also includes the use of [LangSAM](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything), an innovative integration of two powerful models: the foundation model [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and the visual grounding model [Grounding Dino]( https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO). This combination enables the use of textual prompts with SAM on remote sensing data.
