Welcome to the official repository for our paper titled "Zero-Shot Refinement of Buildingsâ€™ Segmentation Models using SAM" to appear at the 5th International Electronic Conference on Remote Sensing (ECRS 2023).

## Overview

Our research focuses on  a zero-shot refinement approach where the inference results of a CNN trained for buildings' segmentation from remote sensing images are passed as input to SAM. This repository contains the code and resources used to produce the results presented in our paper. Also, this repo hosts related materials for our live demo entitled "Zero-Shot Buildings' Segmentation using SAM" at the 5th NOAA Workshop on Leveraging AI in Environmental Sciences.

## Key Features

- AI models Implementation for building segmentation in remote sensing.
  - *Coming Soon!* Stay tuned!
  
- A comprehensive Colab notebook for a live demo presented at the 5th NOAA AI Workshop.
  - This notebook contains a demo of the implementation of two CNNs acting as prompt generators for [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) on remote sensing data.
  - It also includes the use of [LangSAM](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything), an innovative integration of two powerful models: the foundation model [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and the visual grounding model [Grounding Dino]( https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO). This combination enables the use of textual prompts with SAM on remote sensing data.
