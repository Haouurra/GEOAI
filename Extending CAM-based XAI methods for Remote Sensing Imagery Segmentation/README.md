Welcome to the official repository for our paper titled "Extending GradCam-based XAI methods for Remote Sensing Imagery Segmentation" to appear at the 5th International Electronic Conference on Remote Sensing (ECRS 2023).
Paper: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01837.pdf)

## Overview

This paper offers to bridge this gap by adapting the recent XAI classification algorithms and making them usable for muti-class image segmentation, where we mainly focus on buildingsâ€™ segmentation from high-resolution satellite images. To benchmark and compare the performance of the proposed approaches, we introduce a new XAI evaluation methodology and metric based on "Entropy" to measure the model uncertainty.

## Installation 


## Implementation
To run our approach prediction you need to run main function and you can change arguments in order to select specific CNN model and select specific prompt type:

For the CNN model choose either *multiclassUnet* (Multiclass Unet CNN model) or *DCNN* (Dlink-Net CNN model).

For prompt type you can choose one of these prompts
