## [Empirical Study of PEFT techniques for Winter Wheat Segmentation](https://geogroup.ai/publication/2023ecrs_peftwheat/2023ECRS_PEFTWheat.pdf)

The aim of this work is to explore efficient fine-tuning approaches for crop monitoring. Specifically, we focus on adapting the SOTA TSViT model, recently proposed in CVPR 2023, to address winter wheat field segmentation, a critical task for crop monitoring and food security, especially following the Ukrainian conflict, given the economic importance of wheat as a staple and cash crop in various regions.

## [Zero-Shot Refinement of Buildings’ Segmentation Models using SAM](https://geogroup.ai/publication/2023ecrs_zeroshotsam/2023ECRS_ZeroShotSAM.pdf)

We introduce different prompting strategies, including integrating a pre-trained CNN as a prompt generator. This novel approach augments SAM with recognition abilities, a first of its kind. We evaluated our method on three remote sensing datasets, including the WHU Buildings dataset, the Massachusetts Buildings dataset, and the AICrowd Mapping Challenge.
